## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Yahoo API Module Structure (2025-01-XX)

**Decision:** Implement modular architecture for Yahoo API integration

**Rationale:**
- Single responsibility principle
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Fail-fast error handling

**Structure:**
```
lib/yahoo/
  ├── config.ts          # Single source of truth for OAuth redirect URI
  ├── client.ts          # Core API client for authenticated requests
  ├── normalize.ts       # Response normalization utilities
  ├── season.ts          # Season detection from game endpoint
  ├── statDefinitions.ts # Stat definitions cache and lookup
  ├── standings.ts       # Dedicated standings parser
  └── roster.ts          # Roster parsing utilities
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### 2. OAuth Redirect URI (2025-01-XX)

**Decision:** Single source of truth with validation on boot

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates branching logic
- Prevents redirect URI mismatches
- Fail-fast on misconfiguration
- Reduces log noise

**Implementation:**
- `YAHOO_REDIRECT_URI` constant in `lib/yahoo/config.ts`
- Validated on module load (HTTPS, no trailing slashes, valid URL)
- Logs once on startup, not per request
- Throws error if misconfigured

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### 3. Response Normalization (2025-01-XX)

**Decision:** Unified normalizer with declarative path extraction

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates complex nested loops
- Handles Yahoo's variable response structures
- Easier to maintain and debug

**Implementation:**
- `normalizeYahooNode()` - Extracts first element from Yahoo arrays
- `findFirstPath()` - Declarative path extraction with multiple fallback paths

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### 4. Season Detection (2025-01-XX)

**Decision:** Canonical source from game endpoint, not league or game_key guessing

**Rationale:**
- Game endpoint is authoritative
- Prevents future breakage from game_key changes
- Cached globally by game_key

**Implementation:**
- `getSeason()` in `lib/yahoo/season.ts`
- Fetches from `game/{gameKey}` endpoint
- Extracts season year (e.g., "2025" from "2025-26")
- Fail-fast if season cannot be determined

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### 5. Stat ID Mapping (2025-01-XX)

**Decision:** Dynamic mapping only, no hardcoded stat IDs

**Rationale:**
- Stat IDs may change between seasons
- Hardcoded mappings cause incorrect stats
- Fail-fast if stat definitions unavailable

**Implementation:**
- `getStatDefinitions()` fetches from `game/{gameKey}/stat_categories`
- `getStatIdByName()` provides dynamic lookup
- Cached globally by game_key
- No fallback to hardcoded IDs

**Status:** ✅ Module created, 🚧 Integration pending

---

### 6. Standings Parser (2025-01-XX)

**Decision:** Dedicated parser with fail-fast, no silent 0-0-0 defaults

**Rationale:**
- Standings are critical for team records
- Silent defaults hide data issues
- Better error visibility

**Implementation:**
- `parseStandings()` in `lib/yahoo/standings.ts`
- Searches local team response first
- Falls back to league standings endpoint
- Throws error if standings cannot be found

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### 7. Roster Parser (2025-01-XX)

**Decision:** Normalize players to flat list from nested structures

**Rationale:**
- Yahoo's roster structure is complex and variable
- Flat list is easier to work with
- Consistent parsing logic

**Implementation:**
- `flattenPlayers()` normalizes nested structures
- `parseRoster()` provides complete parser
- Handles multiple possible roster structures

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

## Active TODOs

### High Priority

1. **Fix Standings 0-0-0 Records in Production** ⚠️ **URGENT**
   - **Issue:** All teams showing 0-0-0 records (confirmed in production)
   - **Action:** Integrate `parseStandings()` from `lib/yahoo/standings.ts` into sync route
   - **Files:** `app/api/yahoo/sync/route.ts`
   - **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Integrated standings parser into sync route
   - **Next:** Test in production to verify standings are now correctly extracted

2. **Migrate yahooParser.ts to use dynamic stat mappings**
   - Remove hardcoded stat ID fallbacks
   - Use `getStatIdByName()` from `lib/yahoo/statDefinitions.ts`
   - Fail-fast if stat definitions unavailable
   - **Status:** 🚧 Pending

3. **Update sync route to use new modules**
   - Use `getSeason()` instead of `getLeagueInfo()`
   - Use `parseStandings()` for team standings ✅ **COMPLETED** - Integrated
   - Use `parseRoster()` for roster parsing
   - Use `getStatDefinitions()` before parsing stats
   - **Status:** 🚧 Partially complete - standings integrated, others pending

3. **Update yahooFantasyApi.ts to use new modules**
   - Replace `makeApiRequest()` with `client.makeApiRequest()`
   - Use `normalizeYahooNode()` throughout
   - Use `parseRoster()` for roster parsing
   - **Status:** 🚧 Pending

4. **Implement strict coverage type filtering**
   - Only accept `coverage_type === 'season'`
   - No fallback to week or date stats
   - **Status:** ⏳ Pending

### Medium Priority

5. **Reduce logging to 3 levels**
   - Info: high-level flow
   - Warn: degraded behavior
   - Error: failed operations
   - **Status:** ⏳ Pending

6. **Add integration tests**
   - Store real API response snapshots
   - Test parsers against snapshots
   - Test edge cases (empty roster, injured players, etc.)
   - **Status:** ⏳ Pending

### Low Priority

7. **Remove deprecated functions**
   - Remove `extractYahooData()` (replaced by `normalizeYahooNode()`)
   - Clean up old fallback logic
   - **Status:** ⏳ Pending

---

## Unresolved Issues

### API Issues

1. **Stat ID Mappings May Have Changed**
   - **Issue:** Celebrini example shows G:24 A:14 but should be G:14 A:20
   - **Root Cause:** Stat IDs may have changed for 2025-26 season, or using wrong stat set
   - **Status:** 🚧 Being addressed by dynamic stat mapping implementation
   - **Resolution:** Use stat definitions from API, no hardcoded IDs

2. **Complex Response Structures**
   - **Issue:** Yahoo API returns variable nested structures
   - **Root Cause:** Yahoo uses arrays like `[dataObject, subResource1, subResource2, ...]`
   - **Status:** ✅ Addressed by normalization utilities
   - **Resolution:** Use `normalizeYahooNode()` and `findFirstPath()`

3. **Season Detection**
   - **Issue:** Season sometimes not found in league response
   - **Root Cause:** Season location varies in response structure
   - **Status:** ✅ Addressed by canonical game endpoint approach
   - **Resolution:** Use `getSeason()` from game endpoint

4. **Standings 0-0-0 Records** ⚠️ **FIX DEPLOYED - TESTING**
   - **Issue:** All teams showing 0-0-0 records in production (observed 2025-01-XX)
   - **Root Cause:** Standings not found in expected location, old code still in use
   - **Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - `parseStandings()` integrated into sync route
   - **Resolution:** Integrated `parseStandings()` from `lib/yahoo/standings.ts` into sync route
   - **Impact:** All 10 teams were displaying 0-0-0 records, affecting user experience
   - **Priority:** High - visible issue in production
   - **Next Steps:** Deploy and test in production to verify standings are now correctly extracted

### OAuth Issues

5. **Redirect URI Mismatch**
   - **Issue:** OAuth fails with INVALID_REDIRECT_URI
   - **Root Cause:** Complex branching logic, tunnel URLs in production
   - **Status:** ✅ Addressed by single source of truth
   - **Resolution:** Use `YAHOO_REDIRECT_URI` from config
